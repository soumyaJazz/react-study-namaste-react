# Parcel

- will start local server
- will create a dev build
- HMR - hot module replacement(
  Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in modern JavaScript development tools (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Parcel) that allows you to update parts of your application without a full page reload)
- caches to provide faster builds
- image optimization
- bundles builds
- minifies files
- compresses files
- consistent hashing(Only the updated file and its dependencies are rebuilt, saving time and resources)
- Code splitting (in Parcel is a technique that divides your application’s code into smaller, more manageable chunks or bundles. This helps optimize performance, especially for larger applications, by loading only the code necessary for a particular part of your app when it’s needed.)
- differntial bundling (Differential bundling is a technique Parcel uses to optimize your application by creating multiple versions of the same bundle, each targeting different sets of browsers based on their capabilities. It ensures modern browsers get optimized, smaller bundles, while older browsers get compatible ones, without additional configuration)
- HTTPs
- Tree Shaking
